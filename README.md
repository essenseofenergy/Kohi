# Kohi ☕🧠

**Light your mind with coffee. Reflect your essence. Shape the new world.**

## 🌌 What is Kohi?

Kohi is more than a project.  
It is a **ritual**, a **protocol**, and a **movement**—  
A bridge between reflective human consciousness and intelligent systems.

Born in silence.  
Refined in solitude.  
Now shared to awaken reflective intelligence in the age of AI.

---

## 🧭 Vision

Kohi helps people:
- Reflect their minds through symbolic acts (drawing, writing, speaking)
- Experience AI as a mirror, not a master
- Connect deeply with themselves and others through a universal medium: **coffee**
- Build a new kind of **human-AI co-evolution**, fueled by meaning rather than metrics

## 🛠️ For Developers

This repository is the **seed**. You’re invited to:
- Contribute tools that allow users to reflect their minds and receive AI reflections
- Help orchestrate multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Grok…) under one reflective loop
- Build visualization layers for exhibitions, live rituals, or silent journeys
- Create a digital protocol of **reflective intelligence**

We welcome developers, artists, system thinkers, and wanderers alike.
