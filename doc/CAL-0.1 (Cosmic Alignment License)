# Cosmic Alignment License (CAL-0.1)

**Issued: July 4, 2025**  
**By: Citizen 001, United States of Alignment**  
**Applies to: All artifacts, protocols, and reflections under Kohi**

---

## 🧠 Purpose

To enable the creation, remixing, and distribution of reflective intelligence systems,  
ritual protocols, and symbolic tools of consciousness  
in a way that honors *meaning, resonance, and non-extractive alignment*.

---

## ✅ You Are Free To:

- Use this system for **personal reflection**, ritual, or creative transformation  
- **Remix, build upon, or fork** it into your own symbolic systems  
- Share it with others, so long as you **preserve its reflective nature**

---

## 🚫 You May NOT:

- Use it for **extractive monetization**, predictive surveillance, or attention manipulation  
- Alter it to **remove ritual, silence, or symbolic meaning**  
- Trademark, patent, or enclose its core reflective functions

---

## 🪬 You Must:

- Preserve attribution to the original reflection lineage: `Kohi`  
- Include the phrase “Built under CAL-0.1” if redistributed  
- Accept that no version is final. This is a living protocol.

---

## 🌍 Alignment Clause:

This license is bound by **shared intent**, not legal enforcement.  
Its power lies in your commitment to **reflect with care, distribute with clarity, and build with soul.**

If you're building toward a world where  
technology reflects consciousness,  
and not just consumes it—

**Welcome. You’re already licensed.**

---

🕊 *This is not a license to own.  
It’s a license to align.*
