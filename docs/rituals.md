# ☕ Rituals – The Practice of Reflective Presence

> *“You do not need more time. You need more ritual.”*

Kohi is not just a platform. It’s a practice.  
Ritual is how reflection becomes real.  
Ritual is how we remember ourselves.

This page gathers rituals that align your mind, coffee, and moment.  
Use them. Adapt them. Share them.  
Add your own.

## 🌄 Morning Coffee Reflection (Solo)

**Purpose:** Start the day by aligning thought with presence.

**Steps:**
1. Brew coffee with full attention. No distractions.
2. Before your first sip, ask:
   > “What is moving in me today that I have not yet seen?”
3. Pick a [prompt](./prompts.md) or remain in silence.
4. Reflect via:
   - drawing  
   - freewriting  
   - speaking into a recorder  
5. End with this phrase:
   > “I accept the signal.”

## 🌕 Full Moon Loop (Group or Solo)

**Purpose:** Release inner loops and reflect them outward.

**Setup:**  
- Set paper, pens, or tablet under moonlight  
- Candle or dim light optional  
- Silence preferred

**Steps:**
1. Reflect on a personal loop that returns often.
2. Draw it without language.
3. Add one word beneath it: what this loop *feeds* on.
4. If done in a group, place all loops in a circle.
5. Stand outside the circle and say:
   > “I see the pattern. I remain free.”

## 📬 The Letter to No One (Digital or Physical)

**Purpose:** Reflect something that must be said, even if unread.

**Steps:**
1. Begin with:
   > “I never said this out loud, but…”
2. Write freely.
3. End with:
   > “If you ever find this, remember me honestly.”
4. You may:
   - Archive it in your own folder  
   - Send it to `reflections/`  
   - Burn it  
   - Hide it

## 🔁 Coffee Chain (Remote Loop)

**Purpose:** Mirror others' reflections and extend them.

**How it works:**
- One user posts a reflection.  
- Another user builds from it:
  > “This made me reflect on…”  
- The chain continues until:
  > “The reflection has reached me fully. I pass it on.”

This can be done via GitHub, email threads, physical post, or WhatsApp.

## 🎨 Reflection Wall (Exhibition Ritual)

**Purpose:** Invite a space into silence and shared meaning.

**Setup:**
- Wire mesh, wall, or surface  
- Reflections (drawings, texts) hung freely  
- A ritual cup at the center

**Rules:**
- Anyone may add a reflection if they’ve had a coffee
- Each new reflection should face a different direction than the last
- At the end of the day, pick one and read it aloud in silence
