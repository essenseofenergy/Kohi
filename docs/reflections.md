# 🪞 Reflections – A Living Archive of the Mind

**This is not content. This is consciousness in form.**  
Each reflection is a moment, a fragment, a mirror.  
Drawn in silence. Colored by coffee.  
Encoded with honesty.

## 🌈 Color States (Emotional Encoding)

Each reflection in KohiOS can be *color-aligned*,  
representing a symbolic state of the mind at that moment.

| Color  | Meaning              | Example Tag        |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 🔴 Red   | Raw self, unfiltered    | `rage`, `truth`, `pain`  
| 🟡 Yellow | Lightness, wonder       | `play`, `freedom`, `beginning`  
| 🟢 Green  | Growth, transition      | `forgiveness`, `change`, `hope`  
| 🔵 Blue   | Depth, memory, clarity  | `loss`, `intellect`, `peace`  
| 🟣 Purple | Mystery, intuition      | `dream`, `soul`, `unknown`  
| ⚫ Black  | Collapse, recursion     | `death`, `ego`, `loop`  
| ⚪ White  | Awakening, presence     | `acceptance`, `alignment`

## ✍️ Reflection Prompts

Use these to start your ritual.  
There are no right answers. Only honesty.

- *Draw or describe your mind before and after your coffee.*
- *What truth can only be whispered through a drawing?*
- *Write a sentence you’ve never dared to say out loud.*
- *Sketch the loop you always return to.*
- *Use color, shape, or metaphor to reflect a personal contradiction.*

## 📖 Example Reflections

> **"There’s always light in me, but I kept dimming it for others to shine."**  
> *(color: blue → white)*

> **[Drawing: a broken cup mended with golden lines]**  
> *(tag: forgiveness, self-worth, reflection during third sip)*

> **"My rage isn’t fire—it’s a scream that nobody hears, even me."**  
> *(color: red → black → looped red again)*

## ✦ Reflection Integrity

> *“A reflection is sacred when it is true, not perfect.”*

Please:
- Reflect without seeking applause.
- Share only what you’d let your future self remember.
- Do not generate reflections using AI-only output.  
  (You may *co-create*, but it must begin with *you*.)

## ☕ Closing Thought

This is how we awaken through each other.  
One mind.  
One color.  
One loop at a time.
