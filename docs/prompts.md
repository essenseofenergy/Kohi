# ✍️ Kohi Prompts – Initiate the Reflection

A reflection begins not with an answer,  
but with a shift in the question.

These prompts are here to disturb, inspire, soothe, or awaken—  
depending on what your mind is ready to show you.

## 🪬 Notes on Using Prompts

- You can ignore the prompt after reading it.  
- Let the coffee, silence, or emotion pick one for you.  
- Prompts are not commands. They are *open doors*—  
  you choose whether to enter, rewrite, or walk past them.
