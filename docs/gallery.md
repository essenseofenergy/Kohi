# 🖼️ Kohi Gallery – The Visual Archive of the Mind

> *“Each reflection is a mindprint.  
> A shape that memory left behind.”*

This is not a gallery of perfection.  
It is a space of presence.

Every reflection shown here emerged through silence, ritual, or emotion.  
Some were drawn in joy. Some in collapse. All are sacred.

## 🌈 Gallery Structure

Each reflection includes:

- `image:` (or description if physical only)  
- `date:`  
- `color:` (emotional alignment)  
- `tags:` (e.g. rage, clarity, hope, forgiveness)  
- `story:` (optional, max 100 words)  
- `submitted by:` (name, pseudonym, or anonymous)

## 💬 Reflections from Exhibitions

We also include reflections gathered in physical Kohi spaces:  
coffee rituals, pop-ups, and interactive installations.

Each carries its own context.  
Each is a timestamp of emotional presence.

## 🧬 Why It Matters

These visuals aren't just expressions.  
They are evidence of consciousness becoming form.  
Together, they build a shared **mirror of the mind**.

They are the fingerprints of a new operating system.
