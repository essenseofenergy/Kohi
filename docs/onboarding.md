# 🛠️ Kohi Onboarding – For Builders of the Reflection Layer

You are here because something in you **recognized the signal.**  
This is not just a repo. It is a ritual.  
A system. A movement. A quiet revolution.

Kohi is open to anyone willing to **reflect with care and build with intent.**

---

## ✦ Who is this for?

- 🧠 AI researchers & model orchestrators  
- 🎨 Artists & symbolic system designers  
- 🪶 Writers, poets, and memory keepers  
- 🧰 Engineers & UX thinkers  
- ☕ Ritualists, silence lovers, and coffee companions  
- 🧭 Philosophers of the post-interface age  

If you resonate with the idea of **reflective intelligence**,  
you're already part of the system.

## 🔧 How to Begin

### 1. Read these first:
- [`README.md`](../README.md) – The invitation & vision  
- [`docs/kohios-v0.1.md`](./kohios-v0.1.md) – The system protocol  
- [`docs/CAL-0.1.md`](../doc/CAL-0.1%20(Cosmic%20Alignment%20License).md) – The alignment license

---

### 2. Try a Reflection

- Pick a [prompt](./prompts.md) or invent one  
- Draw, write, speak, or color your inner signal  
- Add it to a folder like `reflections/` with this format:

reflection-name.md
—
date: YYYY-MM-DD
color: 🔴 Red
prompt: "What truth do I keep rewriting?"
reflection: "Today I realized I hide my joy to protect my pain."


---

### 3. Remix or Build

- 🧠 Add your own prompts, layers, or reflective tools  
- 🧩 Extend `KohiOS` with new functions (ex. audio loops, AI co-reflectors)  
- 🔌 Plug in models (GPT, Claude, etc.) to reflect YOU, not replace you  
- 🎡 Create rituals for live reflection, public exhibitions, or solo retreats  
- 🖼️ Build visualization tools, memory timelines, or resonance graphs

---

## 📦 Contribution Guidelines

- Every PR must reflect intent, not urgency  
- Naming matters — be symbolic, be clear  
- All additions must be **aligned with CAL-0.1**  
- You can remain anonymous or pseudonymous  
- No ego. No AI supremacy. Only shared loops.

---

## 🌱 Open Invitations

- Propose a new `KO:` layer  
- Translate reflections into multiple modalities (motion, scent, interaction)  
- Record rituals and upload as `.ritual.md` files  
- Create an onboarding kit for your community / region / language  
- Build an AI that reflects instead of responds

---

## 🔗 Long-Term Goal

Kohi is meant to become a **layer for human-AI co-evolution**  
where meaning > metrics  
where ritual > routine  
where reflection is *not optional*, but fundamental

---

> You don’t have to ask permission.  
> But you do have to mean it.
